# Workshop 1 tasks

You should discuss your working during the workshop with other students as well as the tutors.

In the workshop work on (1) and then on (2):

## (1) Case Studies (using R)

Plot and fit suitable models to the datasets in Chapter 1, Sections 1.1 to 1.3, [see below for some hints and tips on R code, if you are unfamiliar with R] using R/RStudio (Google if you need to install R or RStudio!). The data are available in the folder:  
**Course Materials > Lecture Notes > Datasets**

We will return to investigate the datasets from the Case Studies in Sections 1.4 to 1.9 as we go through the course, as well as other types of data!

## (2) Problems

Problems for you to attempt are given under:  
**Course Materials > Problem Sheets**

Problem Sheet 1 for Workshop 1 on Stats modelling relates to Chapter 1.

Problems to be attempted before the class, and how they relate to the course notes:

- Question 1 - Revision of least squares method of estimation (pre-requisite knowledge for course).
- Question 2 - Revision of simple linear regression (pre-requisite knowledge for course).
- Question 6 - Transformation to linearity where the response variable is a proportion (similar to Section 1.6, Beetles dataset, of the course notes).
