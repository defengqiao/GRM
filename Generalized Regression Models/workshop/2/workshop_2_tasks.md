# Workshop 2 tasks

## (1) Case Study on Linear Models (using R)

The case study involves conducting a statistical analysis in R using linear models to investigate the relationship between property prices and various explanatory variables, such as, size of property, number of bedrooms, etc. The case study description and dataset are given below.

Work through this case study before the class, if possible, then you will be able to discuss your results with classmates and tutors at the workshop. Aim to produce a draft report on your analyses as this will help you get the most out of the workshop. [See below for some hints and tips on R code, if you are unfamiliar with R.]

## (2) Problem Sheet 2: The problems are available under

Course Materials > Problem Sheets

Problem Sheet 2 for Workshop 2 on the Exponential family relates to Chapter 2.

Problems to be attempted before the class, and how they relate to the course notes:

- Question 1(ii) - Similar to Normal/Poisson examples covered in Chapter 2 of the notes (Section 2.1).
- Question 2(ii) - Similar to examples covered in Chapter 2 of the notes (Section 2.2), including the Bats data example.
- Question 3 - Shows that the least squares method of estimation is maximum likelihood estimation (MLE, Section 2.2) for Normal data (MLE is pre-requisite knowledge for course).

You should discuss your working at the workshop, with other students as well as the tutors.
