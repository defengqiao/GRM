# Workshop 5 tasks

## (1) Case Study on GLMMs (using R)

The case study involves conducting a statistical analysis in R using GLMMs, to investigate dental growth rate amongst children. The case study description and dataset are given below.

Work through this case study before the class, if possible, then you will be able to discuss your results with classmates and tutors at the workshop. Aim to produce a draft report on your analyses as this will help you get the most out of the workshop. [See below for some hints and tips on R code.]

## (2) Problem Sheet 5: The problems are available under

Course Materials > Problem Sheets  
Problem Sheet 5 for Workshop 5 on Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) relates to Chapter 5, as well as LMMs and GLMMs.

Problems to be attempted before the class, and how they relate to the course notes:

- Question 1 - An application of GLMs to Poisson regression in Chapter 5 (Sections 5.1 to 5.3 and 5.5).
- Question 2 - An application of analysis of deviance to Poisson regression for testing parameters in GLMs in Chapter 5 (Section 5.4).

The data are from:  
Course Materials > Lecture Notes > Example: Poisson Regression in R

You should discuss your working at the workshop, with other students as well as the tutors, to ensure that you have good understanding of the material from the notes. Also, of course, please look at the other questions on Problem Sheet 5.
