# Workshop 4 tasks

## (1) Case Study on GLMs (using R)

The case study involves conducting a statistical analysis in R using GLMs, based on a Poisson model, to investigate the relationship between the number of books a school pupil may read within a year and various explanatory variables, including school attended, maths test score, English test score. The case study description and dataset are given below.

Work through this case study before the class, if possible, then you will be able to discuss your results with classmates and tutors at the workshop. Aim to produce a draft report on your analyses as this will help you get the most out of the workshop. [See below for some hints and tips on R code, if you are unfamiliar with R.]

## (2) Problem Sheet 4: The problems are available under

Course Materials > Problem Sheets  
Problem Sheet 4 for Workshop 4 on inference for Linear Models relates to Chapter 4.

Problems to be attempted before the class, and how they relate to the course notes:

- Question 1 - An application of t-test for testing a single parameter in Chapter 4 (Sections 4.2 and 4.3).
- Question 2 -  An application of F-test for testing several parameters simultaneously in Chapter 4 (Sections 4.4 and 4.5).  This question involves the barometer data set from lectures and the data are available under:  
Course Materials > Lecture Notes > Datasets

You should discuss your working at the workshop, with other students as well as the tutors, to ensure that you have good understanding of the material from the notes. Also, of course, please look at the other questions on Problem Sheet 4.
